{"Implementation approach":"To address the complex requirements of developing 'Nano-Code' for blockchain interoperability, we will leverage the Python programming language due to its versatility and the extensive range of available open-source libraries. The primary open-source framework we will utilize is the 'Interledger' protocol, which is designed to connect different blockchains and payment networks. Additionally, we will explore the use of 'PyCryptodome' for cryptographic functions and 'Flask' for creating a user-friendly API interface.","File list":["main.py","nano_code.py","blockchain_interface.py","readme_viewer.py","api_server.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        +main() str\n    }\n    class NanoCode {\n        -Interledger interledger\n        +create_compatible_blockchain() BlockchainInterface\n        +integrate_with_blockchain(blockchain: BlockchainInterface)\n    }\n    class BlockchainInterface {\n        -transactions list\n        +add_transaction(transaction: dict)\n        +get_transactions() list\n    }\n    class ReadMeViewer {\n        +display_readme() str\n    }\n    class APIServer {\n        +start_server()\n        +stop_server()\n    }\n    Main --> NanoCode\n    NanoCode --> BlockchainInterface\n    Main --> ReadMeViewer\n    Main --> APIServer\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant NC as NanoCode\n    participant BI as BlockchainInterface\n    participant RMV as ReadMeViewer\n    participant AS as APIServer\n    M->>NC: create_compatible_blockchain()\n    NC-->>BI: return BlockchainInterface\n    M->>NC: integrate_with_blockchain(BI)\n    M->>RMV: display_readme()\n    M->>AS: start_server()\n    Note over M, AS: Server runs to handle API requests\n    AS->>NC: integrate_with_blockchain(BI)\n    NC-->>AS: return success/failure\n    M->>AS: stop_server()\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specifics of the 'Nano-Code' technology are not fully defined, including the exact mechanisms by which it will achieve compatibility with all other blockchains and currencies.
