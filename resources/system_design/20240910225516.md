## Implementation approach

To address the complex requirements of developing 'Nano-Code' for blockchain interoperability, we will leverage the Python programming language due to its versatility and the extensive range of available open-source libraries. The primary open-source framework we will utilize is the 'Interledger' protocol, which is designed to connect different blockchains and payment networks. Additionally, we will explore the use of 'PyCryptodome' for cryptographic functions and 'Flask' for creating a user-friendly API interface.

## Data structures and interfaces

    class Main {
        +main() str
    }
    class NanoCode {
        -Interledger interledger
        +create_compatible_blockchain() BlockchainInterface
        +integrate_with_blockchain(blockchain: BlockchainInterface)
    }
    class BlockchainInterface {
        -transactions list
        +add_transaction(transaction: dict)
        +get_transactions() list
    }
    class ReadMeViewer {
        +display_readme() str
    }
    class APIServer {
        +start_server()
        +stop_server()
    }
    Main --> NanoCode
    NanoCode --> BlockchainInterface
    Main --> ReadMeViewer
    Main --> APIServer


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant NC as NanoCode
    participant BI as BlockchainInterface
    participant RMV as ReadMeViewer
    participant AS as APIServer
    M->>NC: create_compatible_blockchain()
    NC-->>BI: return BlockchainInterface
    M->>NC: integrate_with_blockchain(BI)
    M->>RMV: display_readme()
    M->>AS: start_server()
    Note over M, AS: Server runs to handle API requests
    AS->>NC: integrate_with_blockchain(BI)
    NC-->>AS: return success/failure
    M->>AS: stop_server()


## Anything UNCLEAR

The specifics of the 'Nano-Code' technology are not fully defined, including the exact mechanisms by which it will achieve compatibility with all other blockchains and currencies. Further technical details and a clear specification of how 'Nano-Code' will be integrated into existing blockchains are required for a complete architectural design.
