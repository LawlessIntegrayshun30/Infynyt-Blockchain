## Programming Language

Python

## Original Requirements

Develop a new blockchain technology that uses another new coding technology that we will develop called 'Nano-Code.' This Nano-Code will allow us to create a blockchain that is compatible with all other blockchains and currencies from all of those other blockchains. Be sure to include a comprehensive 'Read Me' file and please make sure the final output is test and launch ready. Good Luck!

## Project Name

universal_blockchain_compatibility

## Product Goals

- Enable seamless interoperability between different blockchains
- Develop the 'Nano-Code' technology to facilitate blockchain compatibility
- Ensure the product is user-friendly with comprehensive documentation and is ready for testing and launch

## User Stories

- As a cryptocurrency user, I want to be able to perform transactions across different blockchains without worrying about compatibility issues
- As a blockchain developer, I want to integrate 'Nano-Code' into my projects to make them compatible with other currencies and blockchains
- As a new user, I want to easily understand how to use 'Nano-Code' through the 'Read Me' file so I can implement it without any hassle

## Competitive Analysis

- Blockchain A: Offers limited compatibility with major cryptocurrencies
- Blockchain B: High transaction fees and slow cross-chain transfers
- Blockchain C: Supports multiple currencies but lacks documentation and ease of integration
- Blockchain D: Good interoperability but not user-friendly for developers
- Blockchain E: Compatible with several blockchains but has scalability issues
- Blockchain F: Provides a comprehensive API but lacks a strong developer community
- Blockchain G: Fast and efficient but supports a limited number of blockchains

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires the development of a new coding technology, 'Nano-Code,' which will be the foundation for creating a universally compatible blockchain. The blockchain must be testable, launch-ready, and include a comprehensive 'Read Me' file for users. The technology must be designed to integrate with existing blockchains and support transactions with various cryptocurrencies.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', "Develop the 'Nano-Code' technology to enable blockchain interoperability"]
- ['P0', 'Ensure the blockchain is compatible with all other blockchains and currencies']
- ['P0', "Create a comprehensive 'Read Me' file for easy understanding and implementation"]
- ['P1', 'Design the system to be test and launch ready']
- ['P2', "Build a strong developer community around the 'Nano-Code' technology"]

## UI Design draft

The UI will feature a dashboard for users to manage cross-chain transactions, a section for developers with integration guides, and a comprehensive 'Read Me' viewer. The design will be clean and modern, with an emphasis on simplicity and ease of navigation.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specifics of how 'Nano-Code' will be developed and its technical details are unclear. Further information on the coding technology and its integration process is needed.
